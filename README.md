# Word Frequency Analysis in Reddit Comments
Welcome to the Word Frequency project! This project aims to analyze word frequencies in Reddit comments over an eight-year period, providing insights into cultural and linguistic shifts over time.

## Overview
This project focuses on using efficient MapSet implementations to determine word frequencies in large text documents. The ability to identify word frequencies in extensive corpuses is fundamental to various research projects in digital social sciences. Our specific aim is to analyze the evolution of language and cultural discourse through the lens of Reddit comments, spanning eight years.

## Key Features
+ **Efficient Data Structures**: Utilizes MapSet implementations for high-efficiency data processing.
+ **Large-Scale Text Analysis**: Designed to handle large text files, such as years' worth of Reddit comments, without performance bottlenecks.
+ **Cultural and Linguistic Insight**s: Provides a platform to explore how word usage and language evolve over time, reflecting broader cultural shifts.
+ **Historical Data Analysis**: Employs historical data from Reddit to track and analyze trends over a substantial period.
+ **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a simple, intuitive interface for inputting data and retrieving results.

## Getting Started:
To dive into this simulation, simply clone the repository, run the WordCounter.java file in your command line, first inputing the path of your reddit comment data set. This tool is an excellent resource for researchers, linguists, and anyone interested in the dynamic nature of language and culture as reflected in digital platforms like Reddit.
